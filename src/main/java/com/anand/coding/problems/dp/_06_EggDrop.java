/**
 *  Find minimum number of trials needed in worst case with n eggs and k floors
 *  to find the critical floor upto which the egg won't break on dropping.
 *
 * Example:
 * 1. 2 eggs, k floors:
 *
 *    Let the minimum trials be x with trials on floors: x, x+(x-1), x+(x-1)+(x-2) ...
 *    Then total coverage,
 *          x + (x-1) + (x-2) + ...  + 2 + 1 = x(x+1)/2
 *
 *    Now for k floors:
 *             x(x+1)/2 >= k
 *          => x2 +x - 2k = 0
 *          => x = (-1 + âˆš1+8k) / 2
 *
 *    for k=100, x = 13.65 = 14 (integer)
 *
 *
 * 2. For n eggs, k floors:
 *    -> Recursive approach (with memoization) to find all possible combinations and take minimum among them
 *
 *    -> Iterative tabulation approach.
